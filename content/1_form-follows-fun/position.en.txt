Title: Form follows fun!

----

Declaration: Design has to be fun - for me and for those I do it for! As designers, we often divide projects into two categories: Bread jobs and fun jobs. So fun at work and monetary earnings are played off against each other. This cannot be the mental maxim! The challenge of our profession is not only to design, but also to sensitise clients to design and to involve them in processes - ultimately to let them share in our passion.

----

Implementation:

- The separation between bread jobs and fun jobs is abolished.
- Processes and structures are made visible and explained to clients.
- We do not work for someone, but with our clients.
- We do not let people work for us, but work with our project partners.
