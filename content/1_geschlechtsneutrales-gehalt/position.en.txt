Slug: gender-neutral-pay

Declaration: Women earn on average 21% less than their male colleagues in the same position. A gender pay gap also exists in the design industry, depending on the profession and position, this averages between 6 and 18 per cent. That is why we are committed to paying equal wages. Both in employment and in freelance cooperation, gender must not play a role in wages.

Implementation:

- Equal pay regardless of gender.
- Equal conditions regardless of gender.
- Disclosure of all salaries.
