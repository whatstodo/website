Text: <p>Here you will find explanations on how to use and expand whatstodo. If you have any questions, please send us an email. We welcome feedback and are happy to help.</p><p>Sign position<br>On the main page you will find a list of positions, the whatstodo list. You can put a tick in front of each item to select it. With a click on the speech bubble you can sign your selected positions. On the main page, as soon as you have logged in, you will always see all the positions you have signed.</p><p>Add position<br>Once you have selected one or more positions and signed them by clicking on the speech bubble, you will be taken to an overview of all the positions you have signed. Here you can add a public note to each position. A note is an individual addition to the position. You have the possibility to adapt the position to your needs: Add an exception or extension or share further references to the position with others. Only one note can be added to each position. Notes can also be added, edited or deleted later.</p><p>Add a position<br>To publish a new item, use + Add item at the beginning of the whatstodo list. This will take you to a form where you can write and publish your item.</p><p>A position consists of four parts:</p><p>Title (max. 50 characters)<br>Declaration (max. 1500 characters)This is where the position is described in detail: What does it stand for, what does it oppose?<br>Implementation (max. 1500 characters)Here concrete points are mentioned on how the position can be implemented in practice.<br>References (max. 500 characters)Sources and individual references can be noted here or external further information and instructions on the position can be shared.<br>A position should relate to a specific topic and not cover several different areas at the same time. It should be written in such a way that other designers can also implement it. Arguments and examples should be supported by sources and described in a comprehensible way.</p><p>Positions are considered public property on whatstodo and have no authors. They are published under a Creative Commons licence (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) by whatstodo. As soon as you have submitted the position, our editorial team will check whether it corresponds to our self-image. If everything fits, it will be published and you will receive a confirmation by email. With the publication you automatically sign the position. Positions cannot be edited or deleted afterwards, as other participants can also sign them.</p><p>Remove signature<br>If you no longer represent a position and want to remove your signature from it, you can do so on the main page. After you have logged in, all the positions you have signed will automatically appear on the whatstodo list. Simply uncheck the relevant item and click on the bubble. The current selection will now be saved.</p><p>Login &amp; Logout<br>Under Login you can log in with your e-mail address and password. If you have forgotten your password, you will also find a link here. If you are already registered, your name will appear in the top right-hand corner of the website. Here you can access the overview of your data.</p><p>Register &amp; delete account<br>If you do not have an account yet and would like to register with whatstodo, you will find a corresponding link under Login. If you want to delete your account, you will find a corresponding link under the menu item Your data as soon as you have logged in. If you delete your account, your signatures and notes will be removed. Furthermore, all your personal data stored on our servers will be deleted.</p><p>Report position<br>If you suspect that a position does not correspond to whatstodo's self-image or if you see another problem with a position, please contact us directly by e-mail. Our editorial team will discuss each individual case and possibly take further action. If necessary, they will contact you again directly for further questions and inform you of our decision.</p>
